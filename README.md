[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/snyk-tech-services/snyk-api-import/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/snyk/snyk-api-import)

Snyk helps you find, fix and monitor for known vulnerabilities in your dependencies, both on an ad hoc basis and as part of your CI (Build) system.

# Snyk api import
Snyk API project importer. This script is intended to help import projects into Snyk with a controlled pace utilizing available [Snyk APIs](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/) to avoid rate limiting from Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket etc and to provide a stable import. The script will kick off an import in batches, wait for completion and then keep going. Any failed requests will be retried before they are considered a failure and logged.

If you need to adjust concurrency you can stop the script, change the concurrency variable and start again. It will skip previous repos/targets that have been requested for import.

What you will need to have setup in advance:
- your [Snyk organizations](docs/orgs.md) should be setup before running an import
- your Snyk organizations configured with some connection to SCM (Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket etc) as you will need the `integrationId` to generate the import files.
- Recommended: have [notifications disabled](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/organizations/notification-settings/set-notification-settings) for emails etc to avoid receiving import notifications
- Recommended: have the [fix PRs and PR checks disabled](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/integrations/integration-settings/update) until import is complete to avoid sending extra requests to SCMs (Github/Gitlab/Bitbucket etc)

# FAQ

<summary><code>Error: ENFILE: file table overflow, open</code> or <code>Error: EMFILE, too many open files</code></summary>
<br/>
  <p>If you see these errors then you may need to bump <b>ulimit</b> to allow more open file operations. In order to keep the operations more performant tool logs as soon as it is convenient rather than wait until very end of a loop and log a huge data structure. This means depending on number of concurrent imports set the tool may exceed the system default <b>ulimit</b>.</p>
  <p>Some of these resources may help you bump the <b>ulimit</b>:</p>

<summary>Does this work with brokered integrations?</summary>
<br/>
  <p>
    Yes. because we reuse the existing integration with your SCM (git) repository to perform the imports, the brokered connection will be used when configured.
